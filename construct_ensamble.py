    An iterative algorithm to construct an ensemble of k solutions from the given solutions.
    Uses the reference solution, which is the best performing solution, as the starting point.

        1. The largest minimum distance between candidate solutions and the solutions in the ensemble
        2. The fitness of the candidate solution
    The optimal solutions are selected from the pareto front of the candidate solutions
