### Pareto Neuro-Evolution: A Multi-Objective ensemble construction algorithm

This repository contains code for constructing ensembles of classifiers evolved through population based Neuro-Evolution algorithms. It selects an ensemble of k classifiers from a pool of candidate classifiers, such that the ensemble is Pareto optimal with respect to the objectives of accuracy and diversity. There are also tools for visualizing the parameter space of the candidate classifiers and the ensemble.
